      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="p1">
      Think of your web page like a neighborhood with houses representing
      different elements like headings or paragraphs. The spaces around these
      houses are similar to the concepts of margins, borders, and padding.
    </p>
    <div class="h3"><h3>Margins are like the roads:</h3></div>

    <p class="p2">
      Just as roads separate houses in a neighborhood, margins separate elements
      on our page. Imagine each element as one of those orange houses, and the
      margin is the space/road between them, providing a clear separation
      between each of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white space around the green headings is because there is a margin set
      which seperates the headings from the parapgrahs like this margin: 10px;
    </p>
    <div class="h3"><h3>Paddings are like the green lawns:</h3></div>

    <p class="p3">
      Look at the green lawns around each house. This is similar to padding.
      When we give an element padding, it's like adding extra space around the
      house inside the margin which creates a comfortable buffer zone between
      the houses and the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how around the headings there is a light green space around the
      text? Well thats because there is a padding set on each of the headings
      like this padding: 2%;
    </p>
    <div class="h3"><h3>Borders are like the white fences:</h3></div>

    <p class="p4">
      Visualize the white fences around the houses. These fences act like
      borders. The border is the boundary defining the edges of an element and
      its padding. It gives a nice outline to our element and a distinct
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now do you notice the darker green outline around the headings padding,
      well thats the border that I have set for them like this border: solid
      rgb(56, 105, 54) 5px;
    </p>
    <p class="p5">
      In summary, just as roads, lawns, and fences shape the space around houses
      in a neighborhood, margins, padding, and borders help us design and
      structure the space around elements on our webpage.

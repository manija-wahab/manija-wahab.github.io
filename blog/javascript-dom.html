    <h1>âœ¦ JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <div class="contain">
      <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS and JS are similar to the way a human being is, let me
        explain. HTML is a lot like the skeleton of the human body, it shapes
        the basic structure of a person while CSS is like the organs around the
        skeleton like the heart, eyes, flesh, hair and everything else that
        makes a person unique in their own way. Now javascript is a lot like the
        soul of the body, it brings life to the body and animates it like making
        the functions of the body work for e.g the heart pumps blood around the
        body while the eyes are functioned to see the world. So HTML is like the
        basic structure/skeleton of a body while CSS is the way that the body
        looks and all of its unique attributes. JavaScript is what makes the
        body come to life and gives all the organs their fuctions in order for
        it to be a functioning human being. This is the same case for how
        websites work with HTML, CSS and JS
      </p>
      <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow and loops can be very similar to making a burger. Control
        flow is like the order the burger is made so like the bun goes first
        then the first topping and then the next one, similarly in Javascript
        control flow is the order in which functions take place just like how
        making a burger requires a specific order. For e.g you can't put the
        sauce or cheese before putting the bottom bun or else your burger will
        be a disaster. Well Javascript is very similar because the control flow
        decides the step by step in which the script has to take place. Now
        imagine if your friend hates dry burgers and wants to add a lot of sauce
        in her burger, for this you would have to follow a loop to ensure her
        requirements are met so for every topping you add you have to add a
        layer of sauce, this is exactly what loops are like. Loops are like a
        repetitive action without having to type it out again each time.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is similar to a garden. Imagine that you have a lovely garden
        and everything in your garden is a HTML element. You are like the
        Javascript because you have the power to add or remove anything from
        your garden, this is similar to how the DOM interacts with the HTML
        page. Using the DOM you can pull out or add whatever elements you want
        so in your garden you can plant new pretty flowers or remove the weeds
        similar to how Javascript can interact and manipulate the DOM
      </p>

      <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are very similar however they both have different
        purposes. Imagine you have a list of contacts of all of your friends
        saved on your phone. For e.g Contacts: Susan, Anna, Maria, Jin. You can
        always go in your contacts and select who you want to talk to because
        you know Susan is your first contact and Jin is the last person so you
        can easily navigate them. In javascript you can obtain data from arrays
        in a very similar manner so your contacts would look like this: var
        contacts = ['Susan', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Jin']. Now each friend in your
        contacts has their own properties or details like phone number etc. This
        is how you can use objects in Javascript as each item in your Array is
        like an object who you can give distinct properties, so Anna's number
        can be 123 456 789 and her address can be 123 mars street. In
        JavaScript, you can give each object their own properties just like how
        you can save different details for each one of your friends contacts.
      </p>
      <h2>What are functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are like a set of actions. Everytime you need to use the
        microwave you need to take the same set of steps in order to heat up
        your food. First you need to make sure the microwave door is open, once
        its open you need to put your food inside then close the door. Next you
        would select your time and press start. But what if your plate is not
        microwave safe?? Well in your function you can set a if statement that
        checks if the plate is microwave safe then you can continue and press
        start but if its not then it would stop the function and stop you from
        pressing play and causing a disaster. Just like that functions in
        Javascript can help you out to take a set of actions ensuring that your
        requirements are met before excecuting a particular task

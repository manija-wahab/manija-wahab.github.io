        > Once I leave dev academy, I hope to join the tech world and simply
        create. I don’t exactly know what I want to create, but I know I'll make
        something meaningful to me and others.
        <br />
        <br />
        > If possible, I would also like to fulfill my dream of becoming an
        indie game developer. But for now, my focus is solely on entering the
        tech field, expanding my knowledge over the years, and creating many
        things with my skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        > For example, I used to spend hours searching for a good epub reading
        app so I could easily read my books with all the desired features.
        However, I was never able to find one. So maybe when I become a software
        developer, I can create my own app, which might be useful for someone
        else like me!!

        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?

    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > My biggest strength will definitely be my time management. Bootcamp
        will be busier, and I tend to complete work really fast and efficiently
        because I work at my own pace and prefer deep focus on a task,
        completing it once, rather than breaking it into many segments over
        days.
        <br />
        <br />
        > I usually completed most of my foundations work in the first week,
        then spent the next week learning things outside of devacademy to
        further improve. My biggest limitation would be working with people
        because I'm not the best at communicating.
        <br />
        <br />
        > I have a lot of social anxiety and prefer working independently
        because I feel like I have control over everything. But I'm afraid of
        letting down the people I'm working with or being the reason they
        struggle, so that might be a limitation.

        <br />
        > I'm really bad at that, and I feel a lot of anxiety, so I usually
        prefer to work independently. But I know that as a software developer,
        where you work with many people, that's a critical skill you need to
        have.
        <br />
        <br />
        > So I think it's important that I go through this to get out of my
        comfort zone and face my fears. But working in groups still feels a
        little scary and challenging for me.

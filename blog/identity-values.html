    <h1>My Values</h1>

    <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h3>

    <p>A situation where I have made an ethical decision:</p>
    <p>
      I chose to let go of my old friend who had been hurting me multiple times.
      I tend to choose other people over myself, which is what I had done over
      the past few years, enabling them to hurt me repeatedly. This made me a
      weak person and easy to manipulate. However, at some point, I had to make
      the difficult decision of cutting that person out of my life, choosing
      myself and my mental health over them. Despite our great memories and a
      strong bond, I knew that our relationship was unhealthy. Reflecting on
      that decision, I feel grateful as it allowed me to bring better people
      into my life, and I am glad that I chose myself even if it meant hurting
      the other person.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
      your values and identity.
    </h3>

    <p>
      How my culture and the people around me influenced my values and identity:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been raised by a very loving and supportive family that has shaped
      my values, emphasizing respect and honesty. Additionally, my religious
      upbringing has taught me to have gratitude even in the face of horrible
      things in life.
    </p>

    <h3>
      3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
      learning journey.
    </h3>

    <p>My strengths and their role in supporting my learning journey:</p>
    <p>
      Some of my strengths include working well on my own and independently,
      which will be advantageous during my learning journey, given that the
      part-time course involves mostly self-work. I excel in learning at my own
      pace, which aligns well with the part-time cohort. Another strength is my
      compassion and understanding of other people's emotions, which proves
      useful when collaborating with others. If paired up, it will help me
      understand my partner and work effectively with them.
    </p>

    <h3>
      4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>

    <p>My limitations in learning and career development:</p>
    <p>
      I am a little shy when communicating with people, which might be a
      limitation in my learning journey. I struggle when it comes to reaching
      out for help and bothering people, preferring to figure out problems on my
      own. This may impact my learning journey as effective communication is
      crucial for seeking assistance and collaboration.
    </p>

    <h3>
      5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
      others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried
      at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>

    <p>An example of working with resistance:</p>
    <p>
      In my drama class in year 10, I had to work with my group to produce a
      play, but most members were not cooperating. To address this, I took
      leadership and organized the entire play myself, despite feeling shy. This
      was effective, as our group had a plan to work with, avoiding spontaneous
      decisions. Reflecting, I would now focus on communicating with each
      individual member, understanding their perspectives, and including their
      ideas to foster a more inclusive and collaborative environment, rather
      than trying to take complete control.

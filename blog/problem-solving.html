            So, the problem was with this basic JavaScript task where I needed
            to create a loop to iterate over an array and perform a task. It
            seemed simple at first, but I just couldn't figure out why my loop
            wasn't working properly. I tried a few problem-solving techniques.
            First, I went back to the basics of Javascript and reviewed my
            understanding of loops. Then, I tried breaking down the problem into
            smaller steps to see if I missed something. I also tried looking at
            examples online to see if there was a similar problem someone else
            had encountered. Throughout the process, I started to doubt myself
            and ability as I kept thinking, "Why can't I figure this out? It's
            so easy!!!" But I tried to stay patient and give it one more shot
            but this time I decided to plan everything out first and it all
            worked out so I learnt how critical planning is in coding.

            When I was working on creating my blog, I wanted to add glowing
            circles to the background. But making sure they looked good on all
            screen sizes was a little tough. Instead of rushing and being
            reckless, I knew I needed to plan carefully. So, I sat down with a
            piece of paper and drew out how I wanted my blog to look. I thought
            about how it would appear on smaller devices as well such as phones.
            This planning really helped when I started coding. With a clear idea
            of what to do, things went smoothly. I could handle any problems
            that popped up because I had thought about them beforehand. It made
            the whole process much easier and I elegantly solved my issues.

            I feel quite confident using pseudocode as planning beforehand is
            really useful and makes your work a lot easier while the Rubber
            ducky method is something I haven't tried much, but I think it could
            be helpful in clarifying my thoughts through explaining the problem
            to someone or something. Reading error messages has always been
            great help for when i'm trying to troubleshoot my code but
            console.logging is like a hero for me when things get too confusing
            and I think I would struggle a lot if it didn’t exist, just seeing
            what my code looks like at different points is so useful. Google can
            be useful for simple problems but its not that useful for when
            things get too complex. I don’t enjoy asking my peers/coaches for
            help because i’d rather try to solve it on my own and learn using my
            own brain but if things get too tough I feel confident enough to
            reach out for help. Reflecting feels nice to go back and see where
            you went wrong and what you can improve on next time.

            There was this one time when I was stuck on a question for a really
            long time and I couldn't solve it on my own. I kept struggling with
            it for hours because I refused to be defeated by that question and I
            wanted to solve it on my own no matter what. I also felt like my
            question was a bit silly and too easy so I was afraid to ask it.
            However, looking back, I realized that it would’ve been better if I
            had just asked for help as it would’ve saved me a lot of time and
            I've also come to understand that even if your question is silly or
            simple, it's better to ask anyways as it shows a willingness to
            learn and collaborate with others and someone else might also be
            stuck on the same thing and you asking for help could help them out
            too.

        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?

      <p class="answer">
        > I realized that at the start of each challenge I tend to have a high
        ego thinking it's easy and achievable which I think is a good thing
        because it makes me believe that I can do it. However this causes me to
        act recklessly without planning and that never ends too well and once I
        start to see multiple failures my ego drops down a lot and I start to
        get a lot of self doubts however once I complete the challenge I feel a
        strong sense of gratification and joy and I realize that I truly can
        achieve anything as long as I believe myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        > My ego also tends to hold me back from asking for help, I realized
        just how much I hesitate to ask for help and would rather struggle all
        on my own than ask for help I feel like my ego wants me to push myself
        and solve my own problems but when I ask for help I don't feel the same
        gratification that I do when I try to complete a task all by myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        > Overall, the core learning journey has not only deepened my
        understanding of programming but has also shown me some profound
        self-reflection, showing me just how powerful self-awareness can be.

      <div class="questionButton">Question Two</div>
      <div class="question">
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > Values, empathy, and self-awareness are really important when working
        with other programmers. First, values. They're like our guide, helping
        us make fair and honest decisions when we work together. Whether it's
        about respecting each other's ideas or being honest about how we're
        doing, sticking to values like honesty and teamwork helps us build trust
        and get along well with our team and understand their ideas and point of
        view.
        <br />
        <br />
        > Empathy is also just as important, it's about understanding how our
        teammates feel and what they need. When we can see things from their
        point of view, we can work together better, share ideas, and support
        each other when things get hard. It's like being a good friend: you
        listen, you understand, and you're there for each other.
        <br />
        <br />
        > And when things get too stressful for the people you're working with
        you need to be there for them and empathize with them to help them and
        when you're in the same situation you would have that bond where they
        can do the same for you. Lastly, self awareness is about knowing our own
        strengths and weaknesses and how our minds work. By being self aware, we
        can communicate better, take on tasks that we're good at and you can see
        your true potential to grow and improve.

        What has surprised you the most about core learning?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > Learning all about neuroplasticity and growth mindset during the core
        learning was truly surprising for me and how people can learn and grow
        at any age and there is no limitation to learning if someone truly wants
        to learn they can do itttt
        <br />
        <br />
        > Additionally, I've been amazed by just how much self-growth I've
        experienced throughout the process. It's been surprising to see how much
        I've grown not just as a programmer, but as a person, thanks to the
        emphasis on values, empathy, and self-awareness. I honestly didn't
        expect a coding bootcamp like Dev Academy to place such importance on
        topics like mental health and personal development, but it's been
        incredibly rewarding to see how much they care about the students
        wellbeing.
        <br />
        <br />
        > The emphasis on values, empathy, and self-awareness has been truly
        impactful, and it's heartening to know that they prioritize not just
        technical skills, but also holistic growth and support for their
        students.

      <div class="question">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > Delving deeper into your own mind and understanding yourself better
        was definitely one of the toughest parts of the core learning journey.
        Taking a step back now and then to reflect on the patterns of your
        thoughts and how your mind operates was challenging. It's easy to
        overlook these small details and forget to pay attention to them while
        you're busy coding something or stuck on a problem.
        <br />
        <br />
        > When something goes wrong in your code, it's hard to pause and
        consider how you'll respond and notice similar patterns in your learning
        journey. It's like asking yourself, "Am I doubting myself? Do I feel
        like giving up or pushing forward? Do I have a growth mindset?" It takes
        a lot of patience, but it's definitely worth it in the end.
        <br />
        <br />
        > Also finding time every morning to meditate can also be a challenge,
        especially for those who may live in loud environments or have busy
        mornings. It's tough to make time for these important practices and plan
        your day around them but making space for these moments of self
        reflection and mindfulness is crucial for personal growth and
        well-being.

      <div class="questionButton">Question Five</div>
      <div class="question">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > I think Dev Academy focuses a lot on core learning because it can get
        really stressful and in moments like these it's really important to have
        those skills that can help you bounce right back when things go wrong or
        else an individual that lacks emotional intelligence or skills that are
        taught in core, might end up in a stressful situation and then they
        won't be able to cope.
        <br />
        <br />
        > In the world of programming, stress and challenges are unavoidable.
        That's why it's crucial for us to develop not only technical skills but
        also emotional intelligence and resilience. When things go wrong in your
        code or you're under a lot of pressure, staying calm and finding
        solutions is key to thrive in the tech industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        > It's not just about coding, it's about working well with others too.
        Whether we're working on group projects or talking to clients, having
        the right mindset is so important as a programmer

      <div class="questionButton">Question Six</div>
      <div class="question">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space"></div>
    <div class="ansContain">
      <p class="answer">
        > To me, core learning wasn't a waste of time at all. It's like laying
        down the foundation for a sturdy building. Without it, the structure
        would crumble at the slightest challenge. Core learning has taught me
        things that programming alone couldn't, like understanding my own
        emotions better and learning how to navigate through stressful
        situations with a calm mind.
        <br />
        <br />
        > Sure, I could have spent all that time coding, but without the
        emotional intelligence and self-awareness gained from core learning, I
        might have struggled more when things got tough. This whole concept of
        core learning is so well done in Dev Academy because I've seen just how
        much studies can affect the mental health of students in different
        universities. I've seen many students break down and go into depression,
        and I think it's incredible how much emphasis is put on the mental
        health of students in Dev Academy because students are humans too.
        <br />
        <br />
        > Some people can easily be affected negatively when faced with
        challenges, and core learning just teaches students to spend more time
        understanding themselves, improving their emotional intelligence, and
        their resilience when learning, and what it means to be a programmer and
        think like one.

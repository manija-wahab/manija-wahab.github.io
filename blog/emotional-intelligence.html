    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ is essentially emotional intelligence which refers to a person's
      ability to navigate their emotions for example someone who is aware of
      their emotions and has empathy for others usually has a high eq compared
      to someone who cannot control and manage their emotions easily so they
      easily resort to anger and negative emotions. Eq is basically about
      understanding oneself, recognizing and managing your feelings and using
      this emotional awareness to interact with others on a truly emotional
      level so a person with a high eq is emotionally aware and very skilled at
      managing both their own emotions and emotional relationships with others
      and they know how to express their feelings effectively which creates
      meaningful bonds.

    <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      On the other hand IQ which stands for intelligence quotient measures a
      person's intelligence in terms of focus, problem-solving, and critical
      thinking. Unlike eq which focuses highly on how a person can manage their
      emotional self, iq is more focused on how someone can analyse situations
      and information. Both eq and iq are crucial for a person's success even
      though they concentrate on different aspects of the mind.

    <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ is important because it helps you understand yourself at a deeper level
      and others as well it also helps in managing all of your relationships
      including the one with yourself. Developing a high eq can help you handle
      different aspects of your life such as work stress, exams, and
      relationships. With a high eq you can learn to master your emotions making
      it easier to tackle any challenge that comes your way as you will know how
      to deal with your emotions when things get tough. Having a high eq can
      lead you to live a more furfilling and happier life.

    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

    <p>
      My long term goal or career pathway is to use the knowledge I have gained
      during dev academy to begin my career as a junior software developer and
      gain a lot of experiance and advance my skills so in the future I can
      hopefully branch off into different areas in tech such as cloud devlopment
      or devops.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>

    <p>
      My strengths are that I am a really fast learner and I can quickly adapt
      to new ideas. I also know how to organize my time really well and I have
      always been known to complete my work faster so deadlines never become a
      problem for me as I get my tasks finished fast which leaves me with extra
      time to further develop my work/skills with a less stressful time limit. A
      limitation for me when it comes to learning is that I am a little shy so I
      feel shy to ask for help and would rather try to solve my problems on my
      own to the best of my ability before seeking out for help as the last
      straw but I am trying to overcome my anxiety.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
      Academy?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I would like to see more confidence in myself and hopefully I will gain
      better social skills by the end of dev academy as socializing is a
      difficult thing for me to do with people I am not comfortable with so
      hopefully I will overcome my lack of communication skills.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h3>

    <p>
      I will manage my workload during dev academy by making sure I am organized
      and complete my work with quality in my planned time limit so if I am
      working with other people I wont be holding them back. If things start to
      build up for me and I get overwhelemed I will first make sure I am in the
      right state of mind to take on all the work which I normally do by
      meditating. As someone who overthinks a lot, meditation has always helped
      me a lot and I will try to incoperate it in my daily schedule so hopefully
      by the end of the year I will be able to increase my meditation time from
      30 minutes to a hour which will help me calm down and work more efficently
      when feeling overwhelmed if I have lots of work to do.
    </p>

    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>

    <p>
      If I need help I will first make sure to solve my problem on my own to the
      best of my ability and troubleshoot my problems myself, however if I fail
      to do so then I will go search on the internet for a solution from someone
      who was struggling with the same issue. If I fail to do that I will go
      seek help from a friend who may have the possible solution and if not then
      I will ask for help on one of the foundations help channels
    </p>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

    <p>
      I expect the facilitation team to be understanding of my social skill
      issues so they wont be too hard on me as I struggle with it quite a bit
      and hopefully they are there to help out the students when they need help
      but are also take care of their own wellbeing.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
    </h3>

    <p>
      I pray 5 times a day so I wont be avaliable during those times, the main
      one which might come in the way is the evening prayer which is usually
      around 12pm-2pm and takes about less than 10-20 minutes to do. Other than
      that I should be free during the day-time.
